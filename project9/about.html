            <p>knowlege rule world: ‘Knowledge is Power’, is indeed a proverb that is true in every sense. We all know where the power of knowledge can take us. Knowledge helps us in our everyday life to deal with any situation or to solve any problem. No one in life can actually prosper without knowledge. It gives you social power and helps you gain more respect in the society. We humans are the most powerful beings on earth because of the power of knowledge</p>
            <p>‘Knowledge is Power’ is a well-known fact. Without knowledge it would have been impossible for humans and human civilizations to develop. We live in the modern, urbanized nation where one cannot compete with lack of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Education plays an important role in growth and development of a person. One who is well-informed can perform better in life and increase the chances of success. With knowledge and education one becomes a valuable member of the society who recompenses the society with his wealth of knowledge. Education helps us build our opinion or view point on something and voice it. It develops in us the perception of looking at life. It gives us the freedom to express ourselves.</p>
